Welcome to ORCA/C 2.2.0 B1!  This is an update release containing
patches from me and other community members, which fix several bugs
and also add some new features.  For details on these changes, see
the cc.notes file in the Release.Notes directory.

This package is designed to be applied as an update to an existing
ORCA installation containing ORCA/C 2.1.0 or later (including the one
provided on Opus ][: The Software).  To apply the update, simply copy
the files from this distribution into the corresponding locations in
your ORCA installation, replacing any older versions.  (One easy way
to do this is to extract the archive containing this update directly
on top of your ORCA installation, overwriting all modified files.)

In addition to the ORCA shell environment, this update can also be
used under other environments that are compatible with ORCA/C, such as
GNO and Golden Gate.  In these cases, only the directories containing
files from a standard ORCA installation (normally /lang/orca for GNO)
should be updated.  The GNO-specific libraries and headers in other
directories should not be modified; the ones provided with GNO 2.0.6
can be used with this version of ORCA/C.

If you have any questions, or if you want to get involved in ORCA/C
development, please get in touch.  The ORCA/C development project is
hosted on GitHub, and bug reports or patches can be submitted there:

Thanks to:
* Mike Westerfield, for writing ORCA/C, releasing the source code,
  and permitting it to be updated by the community.
* Kelvin Sherlock, for providing several patches and bug reports, and
  for writing several useful tools for modern Apple II development.
* Soenke Behrens, for compiling a list of ORCA/C bug reports and test
  cases, which has helped me to identify and fix a number of bugs.
